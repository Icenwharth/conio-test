The project was create using a starter template for nextJS.

Given the simplicity of the project I didn't use any pattern for the routing of the pages. That't why you can see isLoggedIn checks on the 2 main pages.
The use of localStorage for storing the secret that the user inputs is for the same reason.

I opted to use Next since that is the main framework used at Conio even though I have little practical experience with it, so excuse any big errors while I used it.
For styling, styled-components was used.
